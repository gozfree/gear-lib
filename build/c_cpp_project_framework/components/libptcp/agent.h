/**
 * SECTION:agent
 * @short_description:  ICE agent API implementation
 * @see_also: #NiceCandidate, #NiceAddress
 * @include: agent.h
 * @stability: Stable
 *
 * The #NiceAgent is your main object when using libnice.
 * It is the agent that will take care of everything relating to ICE.
 * It will take care of discovering your local candidates and do
 *  connectivity checks to create a stream of data between you and your peer.
 *
 * A #NiceAgent must always be used with a #GMainLoop running the #GMainContext
 * passed into nice_agent_new() (or nice_agent_new_reliable()). Without the
 * #GMainContext being iterated, the agent’s timers will not fire, etc.
 *
 * Streams and their components are referenced by integer IDs (with respect to a
 * given #NiceAgent). These IDs are guaranteed to be positive (i.e. non-zero)
 * for valid streams/components.
 *
 * To complete the ICE connectivity checks, the user must either register
 * an I/O callback (with nice_agent_attach_recv()) or call nice_agent_recv_messages()
 * in a loop on a dedicated thread.
 * Technically, #NiceAgent does not poll the streams on its own, since
 * user data could arrive at any time; to receive STUN packets
 * required for establishing ICE connectivity, it is backpiggying
 * on the facility chosen by the user. #NiceAgent will handle all STUN
 * packets internally; they're never actually passed to the I/O callback
 * or returned from nice_agent_recv_messages() and related functions.
 *
 * Each stream can receive data in one of two ways: using
 * nice_agent_attach_recv() or nice_agent_recv_messages() (and the derived
 * #NiceInputStream and #NiceIOStream classes accessible using
 * nice_agent_get_io_stream()). nice_agent_attach_recv() is non-blocking: it
 * takes a user-provided callback function and attaches the stream’s socket to
 * the provided #GMainContext, invoking the callback in that context for every
 * packet received. nice_agent_recv_messages() instead blocks on receiving a
 * packet, and writes it directly into a user-provided buffer. This reduces the
 * number of callback invokations and (potentially) buffer copies required to
 * receive packets. nice_agent_recv_messages() (or #NiceInputStream) is designed
 * to be used in a blocking loop in a separate thread.

 * reliable and the socket is not yet connected, %G_IO_ERROR_BROKEN_PIPE will be
 * returned; if the write buffer is full, %G_IO_ERROR_WOULD_BLOCK will be
